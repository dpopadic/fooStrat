Statistical analysis and strategy development for football data

Agenda
------

- consolidate data into single file
- use scrapy to crawl player data from fifa website
- construct automatic data update ETL
- create a factor library (stats / factors by team)
- two types of bets: outcome (h, d, a), goals (later: 1st / 2nd half results, goals)
- approach: compute derived probabilities and compare to offered odds - take positions in the most extreme derivations
- use data lake via dropbox, google drive
