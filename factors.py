# --- goal superiority rating
# - hypothesis: Goal difference provides one measure of the dominance of one football side over another in a match. The
# assumption for a goals superiority rating system, then, is that teams who score more goals and concede fewer over
# the course of a number of matches are more likely to win their next game. Typically, recent form means the last 4,
# 5 or 6 matches. For example, In their last 6 games, Tottenham have scored 6 goals and conceded 9. Meanwhile, Leeds
# have scored 8 times and conceded 11 goals. Tottenham's goal superiority rating for the last 6 games is -3; for
# Leeds it is also -3.
